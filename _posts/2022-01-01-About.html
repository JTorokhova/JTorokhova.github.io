title: About Me
subtitle: "Hi! I'm a business and art student at the University of California, San Diego. I’m currently working towards a dual bachelor’s and masters through the school of Global Policy and Strategy there. I'm passionate about marketing and design, and international politics. My education, and my background as a first generation Russian-American woman helps me understand the nuances of cross-cultural communication. I believe that the key to success is continued learning from peers, mentors, and experiences, and am excited to continued to build my skills in order to uniquely solve any challenge!"
