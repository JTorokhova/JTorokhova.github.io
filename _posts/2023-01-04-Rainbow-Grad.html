    The jewel case uses the insert as a cover, and a print for the back and spine and a sticker on the CD.

        Additional Information
    </center>
</h4>

<p>
    Lavender is steeped in symbolism. I came up with the title for this album after writing all the songs and later
    changed the songs marginally to fit with the title. “Woke Up in Lavender” is based on the phrase “Buried in
    Lavender”. People used to bury corpses with flowers like lavender because of the strong scent of the flowers which
    would mask the scent of the body. It symbolizes a new life, where you were almost gone but now you can live again.
    It’s the experience of waiting for an event to happen or for you to begin something else before your life and really
    begin in full. Lavender also attracts bees, which symbolizes the interactions between one's surroundings and other
    living beings. No matter how alone one feels, there are always other interactions taking place in the world.
