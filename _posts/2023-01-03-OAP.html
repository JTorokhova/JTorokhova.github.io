title: Out and Proud Series
subtitle: "The Out and Proud series is an event series put on by the UCSD LGBT resource center every Spring to celebrate the UCSD LGBTQ+ community. For it, I made print and digital materials to market the events"
description: " The tagline our team collaborated on for this event was 'see me, hear me, feel me', to bring awareness to erasure of community voices and the importance of understanding each individual's story in the community. The Out and Proud Series presents the largest opportunity for community visibility on the UC San Diego campus. It is a time for reflection on the achievements of LGBTQIA+ identified students, staff, faculty, and our allies, and also a time for public awareness and discussion of current LGBTQIA+ issues on the state and national levels."

    The jewel case uses the insert as a cover, and a print for the back and spine and a sticker on the CD.

    The fashion show and clothing swap event was an intern-run event to sustainably exchange clothes and celebrate the community. I used a photograph of one of the interns to make this flyer, and tried to emulate a magazine cover.
